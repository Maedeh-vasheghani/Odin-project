    <h2>Steps for the Recipe</h2>
    <p>To make the dough: In a large mixing bowl, stir together the water, sugar, 2 cups (240g) of the flour, yeast, salt, and butter. Mix until fairly evenly blended.
      Add the remaining flour and stir until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. Turn the dough out and knead it until it just starts to smooth out. You don't want to over-knead it at this point, since it's going to spend a considerable amount of time rising.
      Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let rise for about an hour, until puffy.
      After an hour at room temperature, refrigerate the dough (in its covered bowl) for 8 to 16 hours; overnight is your best bet.
      If you find it too difficult to roll the butter out, you can use a food processor and pulse the butter until smooth, then spread over a sheet of baking paper into the right shape. This makes the consistency of the butter even throughout, however, if you over-process the butter you can introduce air pockets into the butter, so make sure you only use short and fast pulse
